    <div class="padding-example-container">
        <p class="no-padding ex-box">
            <strong>No Padding</strong><br />
            Lots of fun text discussing somethiung important that you need to get out into the world. Unfortunately, this text is so close to the edge of the box, that it looks cluttered.
        </p>
        <p class="with-padding ex-box">
            <strong>With Padding!</strong><br />
            This text looks so much better since it has space between the text itself and the edge of teh box. It is like it can breath; like it can think; like it is luxurious. Mmmmm, this looks good....
